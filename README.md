Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a machine learning project aimed at classifying various human activities such as walking, sitting, standing, laying, walking upstairs, and walking downstairs using data from smartphone sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes. The primary objective is to leverage predictive models to identify and classify activities with high accuracy, facilitating advancements in fitness tracking, healthcare, and wearable technology.

The project uses the UCI HAR dataset, consisting of over 79,000 samples collected at a frequency of 100 Hz. Data preprocessing, visualization, and feature engineering were performed to enhance model performance. Techniques like univariate analysis, multivariate analysis using t-SNE, and feature extraction were employed to understand data patterns and relationships.

Multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Linear SVC, were evaluated for activity classification. Among these, Linear SVC demonstrated the best performance with a training accuracy of 99.56% and a testing accuracy of 98.50%. The results highlight the potential of HAR in improving user experiences and enabling innovations in health and fitness.

Future directions for HAR include its application in personalized healthcare, chronic disease monitoring, and enhanced wearable technologies, showcasing its expanding relevance across industries.
